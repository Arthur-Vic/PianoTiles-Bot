# First try at a Game playing Bot

This is my first try at a bot that is capable of playing the game Piano Tiles. In this game you're suposed to click on the black tiles as they come down and not let them go by (or game will end).

Update:
Added calibration stage so the on screen position of the game isn't coded in.

-Start the script and go to the game window;
-Place the cursor on the first column and press 'W';
-Repeat step 2 for the 3 remaining columns;
-Start the game itself and enjoy!

-Also, press 'Q' to quit.
